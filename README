= Remit =

Remit aims to be a general system for managing MIT student group finances.  The
name comes from "MIT" and the term "remit": One core piece of functionality is
generating the documentation required to make SAFO remit money to students.

It grew out of an effort to ease the UA's treasury, but is intended to be
general enough for other groups to use it.

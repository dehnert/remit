= Installing Remit =

1.  At heart, Remit is just another Django application. Do whatever you normally need to do to install a Django application.
2.  Create local_settings.py containing:
    * SECRET_KEY
    * ADMINS
    * Database configuration
    * SERVER_EMAIL
    * SITE_URL_BASE -- for dev installs, probably "http://localhost:8006" or similar
    * For dev installs, you'll probably want DEBUG=True
    * Any other settings you want
3.  Create local_settings_after.py (possibly empty)
4.  Run "./manage.py syncdb && ./manage.py migrate" to set up the database
5.  Run "./util/setup.py" to install the basic accounts (Assets, Expenses, Income, plus some common GLs)
6.  Run "./util/add_accounts" to add new accounts
    * First argument: path to the base account --- for example, "Accounts.Assets"
    * Standard input: accounts to add, separated by newline (to specify account numbers, add a tab followed by the account number)
7.  Use the admin interface to set up appropriate BudgetTerm(s)
8.  Make sure that the remit/media/ directory gets served to the web as media
